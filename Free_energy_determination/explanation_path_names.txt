In the StructureGeneration folder I have renamed the original (sub)folder names to resemble the naming used in the manuscript and SI.
For the python scripts in this folder and in MLPtraining to work, I had to keep the original names.
To know which folders corresponds to which structures, we link the foldernames here with the foldernames in StructureGeneration.
